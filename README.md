# Number Plate Recognition
This Flask app utilizes a YOLO model, trained on a custom dataset, to detect and crop number plates from vehicle images. It then applies OCR to extract the number as a text string. The app supports both image and video inputs for versatile vehicle plate recognition. 

It can be used for automatic toll collection, parking management tasks, etc.
